How to use:
1) Upload BOTH files (.nojekyll and this README) to the ROOT of your GitHub repository (same place as index.html).
2) Commit to the default branch (main).
3) Open Settings → Pages and ensure Source = Deploy from a branch, Branch = main, Folder = /(root).
4) After GitHub Pages publishes, open the public URL shown at the top of Settings → Pages.
